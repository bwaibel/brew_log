Pliny the Elder Double IPA Clone
================================

Attempt #1
----------

Working off of the recipe in this article in [Vinnie Cilurzo's Lupulin Shift article](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/attachments/0000/6351/doubleIPA.pdf). Brew day was decided last minute, so I'm using Safale US-05 yeast, pitching it in dry.

Grocery List:

    SF-05 Yeast
    13lbs maris otter
    9oz carapils
    5oz crystal 40
    1.5lbs corn sugar
    6oz columbus (ctz)
    5oz simcoe
    1oz centennial

Mash Log:
---------
  
- **2:30** Infused 20 quarts of water at 167 degrees
- **2:35** The water temp hadn't stabilized sufficiently and the heat from the cast iron warmed up the water as it came out. Mash temp was a little high, about 156 degrees. 
- **2:36** Cooled it down to far by adding 3 quarts of ground temp water in one quart increments, getting 147-151 readings
- **2:42** Ended up at 149 after another 5 minute rest. 
- **3:48** Mash rest for 60 minutes, temp was 147, draining stopped early, braid was clogged. 
- **4:00** Sparge would have been 19 quarts, but three quarts went to cooling, so I'm going to sparge at 180 with 16 quarts. 
- **4:30** Final volume was 8 gallons at 1.045 gravity

I had to stop for a few hours at this point family got home and they need dinner.

Boil Log:
---------

- **7:20** Started heat with wort at 120 degrees. Worried about running out of gas so taking it easy.
- **7:53** Boil started, kettle is too full, gonna hold off on the first addition, maybe make it a 60.
- **8:02** - 4oz Columbus
- **8:33** 1oz Simcoe
- **9:08** Strain hops away, put in irish moss, yeast nutrient, corn sugar, place chiller
- **9:08** 1oz Columbus
- **9:20** 1oz Centennial @0 min
- **9:20** 2oz Simcoe @0 min
- **9:20** Eyeball measured the pot, looks about a gallon down from where it started (6.8 gallons in the pot or so), with all these hops and the chiller in there, I figure that's right
- **9:47** Pitch @68 degrees

Final Measurements: 
--------------------

6.5 gallons 1.065 OG

Notes: 
-------

I need to measure my final volume better, needed another 30 minutes on the boil at least. If I had gotten to 5.5 where I wanted to be, the OG would have been (65*6.5)/5.5 = 77, which is what I wanted it to be (if not a little higher).
